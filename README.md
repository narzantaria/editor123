# Goodeditor
Rich text editor in JavaScript (beta-version).

A new text editor with many features, such as:
1. Switch between visual mode and HTML;
2. Text formatting - bold, italics, underline, indexes, headers, etc.
3. Text color and background color;
4. Ordered and unordered list;
5. Alignment;
6. Insert and delete links;
7. Insert image;

> This is a beta version, but it can already be used. I was prompted to create an editor by the fact that the analogues I know do not contain in the free version one or another functional that I personally need. The name of the project is temporary.

## How to use

<img src="/img/screenshot.png" alt="Node.js">

1. Create an empty div with id "editor-container".

```
<div id="editor-container"></div>
```
2. Import JavaScript:
```
<script src="js/editor.js"></script>
```
3. Import css for editor styling:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/editor.css">
```
> Correct the links so that they show the file paths of editor.js and editor.css.

The project will develop (if I find that it is interesting to people).
